# walkinslo-dotfiles
My config for nvim and other stuff!

## How to install nvim config:
1. You have to install neovim using your packet manager of choice.

2. Create the "nvim" folder inside the ```~/.config```.

3. Copy the dotfiles from my repo inside the ```.config``` folder.

4. Prfoit! 
 

(If you want you can rename the "fedor" folder. Don't forget to change it in init.lua too)
